### Introduction:
The paradigm shift toward sustainable transportation has accelerated the prominence of electric vehicles (EVs) in recent years. This transition presents a pivotal challenge: ensuring uninterrupted access to charging infrastructure, especially in scenarios where an EV faces the risk of depletion before reaching a recharging station. To address this challenge, the focus of this project is to conceptualize and develop a portable charger expressly designed for EVs.

The fundamental motivation behind this endeavor stems from the necessity for a versatile and efficient solution to cater to the dynamic mobility needs of electric vehicles. This portable charger aims to bridge the gap in charging accessibility, offering a viable alternative to conventional fixed charging stations. By leveraging advancements in power electronics, battery technology, and charging protocols, the goal is to create a portable charging solution that aligns with industry standards, ensuring compatibility across various electric vehicle models.

This project's significance lies not only in its technological innovation but also in its potential to revolutionize the landscape of EV infrastructure. The ability to provide on-the-spot charging capability has the promise to alleviate concerns regarding range anxiety and bolster the convenience and feasibility of widespread EV adoption. In this pursuit, collaborative efforts among a diverse team of experts aim to steer the development of a reliable and efficient portable charger, addressing the evolving needs of the electric vehicle ecosystem.
